We’ve submitted [our proposal](/proposal) to the [Knight Foundation’s News
Challenge][knight-brief]. From Knight:

> This is an open call for ideas. Elections represent the best opportunity for
> Americans to shape policy and reimagine their shared future. It is a chance for
> people to become and remain involved in their communities and to have a voice
> in local, state and national issues.
>
> For this challenge, we want to discover ideas and projects that better inform
> and inspire voters, as well as make the election process more fun and
> accessible for individuals.

San Francisco collects far more campaign finance data than any other California
jurisdiction and makes all that data accessible and available online.
Comparatively, 92 percent of jurisdictions  in California don’t have
standardized data collection accessible in digital form. 79 percent of
jurisdictions don’t even put this data online, even in PDF form. Because of
this, we think San Francisco is in a unique position to move the bar forward in
voter transparency and engagement.

We hope to inform voters by shedding light on the political dynamics of San
Francisco by connecting these disparate pieces of data. The idea is to build a
storytelling web application that highlights different influence relationships,
patterns of monetary contributions, lobbying efforts and the legislative
process in the city.

This the first phase of the challenge&mdash;idea gathering. We’re hoping to
inspire other jurisdictions in California by showcasing what is possible once
your jurisdiction’s data is unlocked. Please support our proposal by
[applauding it][knight-submission], sharing it, or [giving
