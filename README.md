# Clout Atlas website

This is the source for the statically generated [Clout
Atlas](http://www.cloutatlas.org) website.

## Writing posts

Posts are written in markdown. Just drop a `.md` file in the `_posts` directory
using the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`. Where `YYYY-MM-DD` is
the year, month, and day.

## Previewing your post

The site is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). You'll need it to
serve a local version of the website in order to preview your posts.

### Pre-requisites

- Ruby
- bundle (`gem install bundler`)

### Running the site

    $ bundle install # Updates your ruby dependencies
    $ jekyll serve --watch

Then point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).
